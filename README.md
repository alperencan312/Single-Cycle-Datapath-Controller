This project includes a combination of SystemVerilog language and MIPS Assembly Language. The new structure can be accessible in my final report.

Codes can be executed by using Vivado Tool of Xilinx, and MARS MIPS simulator of Missouri State University.

Assignment has been given by Prof. Dr. Fazlı CAN. I would like to thank to Mr. Rafi Çoktalaş for his consultation.
